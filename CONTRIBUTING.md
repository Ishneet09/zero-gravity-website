Welcome to Zero Gravity Project. This file demonstrates the contributing guidelines that every developer/mentor has to adhere
for GirlScript Summer of Code.
This is required in order to create a unified development environment. Let's start. <br />

## The Git Workflow
The workflow that we'll be using is <b> Dev - Staging - Production</b>. All the Pull Request (PR's) will be made to <b>dev</b> branch.
The mentors shall review the PR. If any change is required in the PR, the mentors shall comment on the PR itself else if
everything is good, the mentors will merge the PR to dev.<br />
Once a feature is completed, the code will be merged to <b>staging</b> branch. At this point, the mentors and admin will perform integration testing.
Once a feature is fully tested, only then it will be merged to <b>master</b> branch.<br />
To read more about this workflow, you can visit [this link](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/deployments/best-practices.html).

## Feature Branching
<b>It is strictly for the participants. Please read it carefully.</b><br />
Every participant(s) is required to make his/their own feature branch from the <b>dev branch</b> and this branch should be named <b>feature-*</b>. For example,
if you are working on media uploader, make the feature branch with name, <b>feature-media-uploader</b>. Push all your code to
this feature branch. Once it is ready for deployment, make a Pull Request to dev branch. Once the feature branch is merged to dev,
please delete the feature branch to avoid confusion.

## Issue creation
<b>It is strictly for the mentors and admin. Please read it carefully.</b><br />
Mentors and admin are requested to make issues and mark them with GSSoC label.

Please reach out to any of the below members for help. Good luck!
